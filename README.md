# Passphrase-Maker
# Make sure you have your execution policy to remote-signed because this is not a signed script
# run newpass.ps1
# newpass.ps1 promts you for an integer 1-10 and a filepath and name to a wordlist
# It will generate a file and delete it, but the new passphrase will be created and printed on the terminal and will stay until you press enter.
